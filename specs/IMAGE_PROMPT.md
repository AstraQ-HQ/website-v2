Create a professional blog banner image (16:9 aspect ratio, 1200x675px recommended).

**BRAND STYLE GUIDE:**

- Color palette: Pure monochrome/grayscale ONLY
  - Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
  - Primary elements: Near-black (10% lightness)
  - Secondary elements: Light gray (96% lightness)
  - Accent elements: Medium grays (40-60% lightness range), used sparingly
- **Flat 2D line-art aesthetic** (outline-focused, no visual depth)
- Sharp, geometric shapes with ZERO rounded corners
- Clean, minimalist, enterprise-grade aesthetic
- Abstract and conceptual - no literal representations

**DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**

- **Very subtle** background texture only (fine grids, dots, or lines)
- **No 3D effects, no shadows, no perspective, no depth-based gradients**
- Consistent, thin line weights throughout
- Geometric patterns, lines, grids, schematic diagrams, or abstract data visualizations
- Iconographic/symbolic elements relevant to the topic, rendered as simple outlines
- Professional and sophisticated - suitable for a B2B cybersecurity/AI company
- NO text, titles, or words in the image

**RESTRICTIONS:**

- NO saturated colors (no blue, red, green, orange, etc.)
- NO rounded corners or soft organic shapes
- NO stock photo elements or realistic photography
- NO generic placeholder imagery
- NO dark backgrounds - light mode only

**REFERENCE EXAMPLES (for visual metaphor inspiration):**

Example 1 - AI/Machine Learning Blog:
Title: "Building Multi-Hop RAG Agents with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning"
Visual approach: Abstract neural network nodes connected by sharp lines, flowing data paths, interconnected geometric shapes suggesting reasoning chains

Example 2 - Technical Infrastructure Blog:
Title: "Building Production-Ready RAG Systems: A Complete Guide"
Visual approach: Vector/grid patterns, database cylinder shapes, search lens iconography, layered rectangular architecture diagrams

Example 3 - Cybersecurity Blog:
Title: "Zero Trust Architecture: Implementation Strategies"
Visual approach: Shield geometric patterns, lock iconography, network grid with nodes, layered defense visualization

Example 4 - Data Engineering Blog:
Title: "Hybrid Search with Dense and Sparse Embeddings"
Visual approach: Intersecting geometric planes, dot matrix patterns, abstract vector space visualization, merging grid patterns

Example 5 - DevOps/Cloud Blog:
Title: "Containerized Microservices Security Best Practices"
Visual approach: Stacked rectangular containers, interconnected boxes with flow lines, modular geometric blocks
